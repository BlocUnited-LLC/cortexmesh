# CortexMesh A2A Adapter Overview

The CortexMesh A2A Adapter is a key component of the CortexMesh ecosystem that enables AG2 agents to communicate seamlessly within the A2A (Agent-to-Agent) framework. This adapter is organized into two main submodules: **Card Generation** and **Task Router**. Each is designed to handle specific responsibilities that together ensure our agents are both discoverable and capable of processing tasks effectively.

## Submodule Breakdown

### 1. Card Generation

The Card Generation module is responsible for creating the agent’s metadata card. This card includes critical information such as the agent’s name, version, capabilities, endpoints, contact details, and license. It is essential for:
- **Discoverability:** Allowing other agents and registries to identify and interface with the agent.
- **Standardization:** Following the A2A protocol guidelines ensures consistent metadata formatting.
- **Integration:** Providing a reliable method to expose agent information for both local and external discovery systems.

This module works as a standalone service within the adapter and is designed to be easily extended or integrated with semantic vocabularies in the future.

### 2. Task Router

The Task Router module is the operational hub for managing incoming tasks. It is responsible for:
- **Task Reception:** Accepting structured A2A task requests via a FastAPI server.
- **Task Processing:** Translating incoming tasks into a format that AG2 agents can understand and process.
- **Result Formatting:** Producing standardized responses (artifacts) with added metadata such as timestamps and protocol versioning.

Additionally, the Task Router includes both a client component (for sending tasks to external agents) and internal logic to route tasks correctly. This submodule bridges external task requests and the internal AG2 reasoning engine.

## How It Works Together

- **Agent Card Generation:** When an external system or registry needs to learn about the agent, it accesses the card generation endpoint. The generated card provides essential details that ensure the agent can be discovered and trusted across the network.
- **Task Routing and Processing:** When a task is submitted, the Task Router receives and processes it by converting the request into a format that AG2 agents can handle. After processing, it formats the result in a way that meets the A2A protocol requirements, ensuring consistent communication and integration with other services.

## Overall Impact

The CortexMesh A2A Adapter empowers AG2 agents by:
- Making them fully **A2A-compliant** and discoverable in the agent ecosystem.
- Ensuring that tasks are handled efficiently with built-in routing, transformation, and artifact generation.
- Laying the groundwork for future integration with discovery, registry, and semantic layers of the CortexMesh platform.

With this clear separation of concerns, the adapter serves as both the identity portal (via Card Generation) and the operational gateway (via Task Router) for agent-to-agent communication, making it a cornerstone of the intelligent agent infrastructure.
